			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi, my name is Michael, people call me Mike or Mikey.</p>
			
<p>I am a data-engineer with big interest in public data and predictive analytics. Recent projects have led me to data mining a range of subjects. From the metro transit authority, to every major underwear retailer in the USA for all kinds of insights. I could easily see a dream job in taking all sorts of freely given data from users. Then organizing, storing, transforming, and visualizing all of it back to them, for them.</p> 
	<p>Taking on an M.S. in Data Science from a backgrond in Liberal Arts was no easy task for me, but I could not have asked for a better start. Recommender systems, simulations, and queuing theory worked harmonously alongside computational mathematics, statistics and probabilites.</p>   
	<p>My hobbies include social events, anything in the sun, any type of game, and model building (Figurines or data-based).</p>
